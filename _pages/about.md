I am a Reader in Mathematics in the [algebra research group](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/pg/pure/Algebra/) at the University of St Andrews.

My current research is in Group Theory. [Mr. Luke Elliott](https://le27.github.io/Luke-Elliott/) is one of my graduate students.

A Group is a pair $(G, \*)$ where G is a set and $\*:G \times G \to G$ is a function satisfying the following conditions:

1) If $x, y, z \in G$ then $(x\*y)\*z= x\*(y\*z)$.

2) There exists $e \in G$ such that for all $x \in G$ we have $e\*x=x\*e=x$.

3) For all $x \in G$ there exists $x ^ {-1} \in G$ such that:

$x\*x^{-1}=x^{-1}\*x=e.$

Other definitinos are:

Defn 2) A group is a semigroup which acts transitively on itself (on both sides).

Defn 3) A group is a cancellative inverse semigroup.

Defn 4) A group is a regular semigroup with equal idempotents.
